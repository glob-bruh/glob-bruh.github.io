<!--
The website used to be hosted on GitHub pages in a repo
called "globbruh-website", which is no longer active. Some
external sources will redirect to that old URL, but this should
trick it into redirecting back to the new homepage. 

The v2 is in the URL because for a brief period of time the actual
glob-bruh.github.io website would redirect to the "globbruh-website"
pages site. This would cause an infinite redirect loop, and this v2
parameter should prevent that.
